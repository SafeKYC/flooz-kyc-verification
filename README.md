# Flooz KYC Process
The Flooz KYC process is one of the most robust KYC check available in crypto. Our service is secured by **Passbase technology** ensuring the most rigorous and legally compliant checks are completed with the aim of bringing trust and transparency to the blockchain.  
If you would like to request a KYC please visit our partnerships store at `partnerships.flooz.trade`
# Important Disclaimer
Our KYC makes no statements, or guarantees the safety and security of a project. It’s also not to be considered as an assessment regarding the utility or longevity of a project.
To obtain a Flooz KYC we require the owner of a project and/or the contract developer to complete our verification process. We’ll also provide their name (as per what they’re known within their own community) on our KYC verification document. We believe this to be important as a team's ownership can change hands over time.
If you believe a KYC to be no longer valid you can contact our partnerships lead at craig@flooz.link  
The information provided in our document does not constitute financial advice. It’s important to conduct your own due diligence, research and consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
